# Meta Front-End Development Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio for the Meta Front-End Development course via Coursera!

## Overview

This repository serves as a showcase of my work and progress throughout the Meta Front-End Development course. As a dedicated learner and aspiring front-end developer, I am committed to honing my skills and building a strong foundation in web development.

## Contents

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

1. **Project**: I will be regularly updating this repository with project and assignments from the Meta Front-End Development course. Each project will showcase different aspects of front-end development, from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond.

2. **Documentation**: I will provide clear and concise documentation for each project, explaining the goals, technologies used, and how to run or view the project locally. This will help you understand the thought process behind each project.

3. **Progress Tracking**: You can track my progress through the commits and branches in this repository. I'll use branches for different project milestones and commits for specific updates or improvements.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to explore my work and follow my journey in the Meta Front-End Development course, simply browse through the repository. Each project will have its own folder, and you can access the documentation and source code within.
